== Description ==

Tabtastic makes creating and displaying tabbed content on your website a breeze. No need to use a ton of shortcodes to display your tabs, either add them as a section to your template or use an easy shortcode to put tabs within your post or page content.

A custom post types Tabs is created on activating Tabtastic. Each tab is a separate post that is assigned to one or more tab sets (like categories). Create your page, select Tabtastic options and your tabs will display.

Say goodbye to a page full of shortcodes and say hello to Tabtastic!
